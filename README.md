# Webpack Configuration

    This repository is created following along the video on Youtube from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs&t=1370s). Here, he also created a simple app to create 'Dad Jokes'. 

    * You can copy only `webpack.config.js` for your webpack setup and add scripts
    ``` "build": 'webpack',
        "dev": 'webpack server',
    ```
    on `package.json` for running dev server using `npm run dev` make sure to run `npm i -D dev` and then enter 'Y' to install dependencies.
