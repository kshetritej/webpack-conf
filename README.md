# Webpack Configuration

This repository is created following along the video on Youtube from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs&t=1370s). Here, he also created a simple app to create 'Dad Jokes'. 

* You can copy only `webpack.config.js` for your webpack setup and add scripts
    ` "build": 'webpack',
      "dev": 'webpack server',
    `
on `package.json` for running dev server using `npm run dev`. You will be prompted to install dev dependencies when running dev server for first time.
